          <h2>Correlations Visualized Between Certain Health Risks and States Median Age and Income Levels!</h2>
          <p>This reporter has mined the evidence to bring you a new visualization about how health risks, like obesity (defined as a BMI > 30), smoking, and 
            lacking healthcare access, can be modulated by certain demographic factors, such as your state's poverty level, 
            median age, and median household income. Check out the chart above to see how your state fares! </p>

          <p>Certain trends become clear to the naked eye, even without conducting a regression analysis. For example, states
            with a larger percentage of poverty house more citizens that may lack healthcare access. The population of these states are
            also more likely to be smokers and/or obese. We can also
            see that the state with the youngest median population (Utah, at 30.5 years old), also has the least number of smokers 
            in the country (at only 9.7% of the population being smokers). 
          </p>

          <p>One of the most striking trends revealed by this data is that the obesity risk is highest in states that have the largest 
            number of people living in poverty or the lowest median household incomes. This link may support previous research that access to fresh, healthy 
            food may either be limited or cost-restrictive in these states. However, it is important to keep in mind that correlation
            does not necessarily mean causation. Further research is needed to identify the nature of the links seen in this article.
